The format of the files hosted on [crowndiamond.org](crowndiamond.org) has subsequently changed, so I'm reposting the earlier copies here (while I rewrite my scraper to deal with the new versions).

According to my email conversations with B. Finton, who originally posted the files on his site crowndiamond.org:

> "All materials on crowndiamond.org are in the public domain."
> 
> "You have permission to use the material as you see fit."
> 
> "I copyright nothing."

Accordingly, in places where it is legal to do so, I dedicate these copies to the public domain. In places where I may not legally do that you may consider them to be licensed under the terms of [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
